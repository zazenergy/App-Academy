#the >= notation always performs upgrades, whereas the ~> 3.2.2 notation only performs upgrades 
#to minor point releases (e.g., from 3.1.1 to 3.1.2), but not to major point releases (e.g., from 3.1 to 3.2). 
#Unfortunately, experience shows that even minor point releases often break things, 
#so for the Rails Tutorial weâ€™ll err on the side of caution by including exact version numbers for virtually all gems.
